Experiments
-----------
* local_simple: compare the dual averaging algorithm to another optimization algorithm (implementation sanity check)
* dist_simple: compare the distributed implementation to a local (single node) implementation (another sanity check)

Helpers
-------
* distddinit: initialize a distributed dual descent instance
* distddstep: perform one step of the distributed dual descent
* gen_cycle: generate a doubly stochastic matrix for a singly linked cycle of size n
* gen_grid: generate a doubly stochastic matrix for 2d wrapping grid of size n
* gen_random: generate a doubly stochastic matrix corresponding to 
	a random connected geometric graph with number of nodes n 
	and link radius r
* plot_random: plot a random graph generated by gen_random()
