Experiments
-----------
* local_simple: compare the dual averaging algorithm to another optimization algorithm (implementation sanity check)
* dist_simple: compare the distributed implementation to a local (single node) implementation (another sanity check)
* cycle_vs_grid_simple: compare different graph types' performance
* random_density_simple: random graph convergence rate vs. link density
* random_size_simple: random graph convergence rate vs. number of nodes (maintaining roughly the same link per node count)
* local_svm: implement the dual averaging algorithm for kernelized no-offset SVM (implementation sanity check)

Helpers
